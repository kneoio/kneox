        <n-card title="About the Project and For Potential Investors" :segmented="{ content: true }">
          <n-text>
            Mixpla lets anyone create their own radio station with AI DJs. Upload your music, choose a personality, and get a radio station that adapts to different situations and talks between songs.<br><br>
            <strong>The Problem</strong><br>
            Radio is outdated, streaming is impersonal. Plus, creators using AI to generate audio content need somewhere to publish it.<br><br>
            <strong>Our Solution</strong><br>
            Simple platform where AI DJs create real radio experiences with weather updates, stories, and personality. We also provide a distribution channel for AI-generated audio content.<br><br>
            <strong>Why This Works</strong><br>
            Users pay monthly for premium features, our costs are low, and the economics are profitable. Each new station makes the platform more valuable.<br><br>
            <strong>Why Now</strong><br>
            The project is currently self-funded, but the market is becoming more competitive. We need investment to grow and capture market share before larger competitors enter.<br><br>

            <strong>About the Founder</strong><br><br>
            I am an experienced full-stack developer with many years in the enterprise sector. After mastering team collaboration, tool utilization, and time management in complex technical environments, I decided to leverage my expertise to create something transformative.<br><br>
            This led me to develop Mixpla: AI-Driven Radio - a platform that redefines how people experience and create audio content. My vision was simple: What if radio could be truly personal and interactive?<br><br>
            Mixpla empowers anyone to become a radio station owner, integrating their music libraries with intelligent AI DJs that have distinct personalities. It's more than streaming - it's a creative canvas with seamless content integration, robust HLS-based streaming, and dynamic content that adapts to any environment.<br><br>
            I'm dedicated to providing tools for a new generation of audio creators, combining my enterprise-level technical skills with innovative AI technology to continuously expand what radio can be.<br><br>
